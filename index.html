          <h3>A. Jupyter Notebooks (The Researcher’s Workbench)</h3>
          <p>
            Jupyter Notebooks are open-source, interactive computing environments originally
            developed from Project IPython. Perez and Granger (2007) describe the system as
            providing “the best possible interactive environment for everyday computing tasks”
            (p. 22). The notebook format combines executable code, narrative text, equations,
            and visualizations into a unified document suitable for experimentation and
            communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Granger and Perez (2021) frame this workflow as human-in-the-loop computing, where
            users iteratively write code, run cells, and interpret results within a transparent
            computing environment.

          <h3>B. Tableau (The Executive’s Dashboard)</h3>
          <p>
            Tableau is a modern Business Intelligence platform built on a proprietary technology
            called VizQL. According to Tableau Software (n.d.-b), VizQL “is essentially a
            translator of SQL queries that traditionally return numbers and tables into an
            effortless visual analysis.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tableau emphasizes rapid discovery for non-technical users by allowing them to
            describe what they want to see rather than how to compute it. The company states
            that its mission is to “help people see and understand data” (Tableau Software,
            n.d.-c).

            How Jupyter and Tableau differ in benefits, limitations, and scalability.
          </p>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>A. Benefits &amp; Opportunities</h3>

          <div class="split">
            <div>
              <h4>Jupyter · Storytelling</h4>
              <p>
                Jupyter excels at narrative-driven analysis. Chen and Asta (2022) describe how
                notebooks can integrate “prose, graphics, slides, and discussion questions”
                into a single learning or research document (p. 3601). This structure enables
                analysts to communicate findings while embedding code and outputs directly in
                context.
              </p>
              <p>
                Granger and Perez (2021) further emphasize that narrative and computation
                coexist to strengthen the clarity and reasoning behind analytic workflows.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Tableau · Democratization</h4>
              <p>
                Tableau removes the technical barrier of coding by allowing users to construct
                visualizations through drag-and-drop operations. VizQL’s declarative interface
                enables users to “describe what picture should be created, not necessarily how
                to make it” (Tableau Software, n.d.-b).
              </p>
              <p>
                Tableau also stresses organizational enablement: its product overview positions
                the platform as a tool designed to empower people and organizations to make
                meaningful use of their data (Tableau Software, n.d.-c).
              </p>

          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>B. Challenges &amp; Limitations</h3>

          <div class="split">
            <div>
              <h4>Jupyter · Reproducibility</h4>
              <p>
                A key challenge is computational reproducibility. Samuel and Mietchen (2024)
                note that when notebooks are executed in different environments or run out of
                order, results can diverge due to hidden execution states (p. 2). This affects
                scientific transparency and repeatability.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beg et al. (2021) add that notebook-based workflows may become difficult to
                navigate when too much code resides in a single file, potentially affecting
                readability (p. 38). They also emphasize that researchers benefit when
                documentation structures reduce the need to “search for parts of the study”
                across fragmented scripts (p. 3).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Tableau · Design Consistency &amp; Governance</h4>
              <p>
                At organizational scale, Tableau dashboards often suffer from inconsistency.
                Srinivasan (2025) highlights the phenomenon of the “dashboard zoo,” where
                ungoverned dashboard proliferation leads to clutter and variability in design
                quality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tableau’s governance documentation warns that without proper processes, legacy
                habits from “traditional reporting” can hinder scalability and cause
                duplication of content (Tableau Software, n.d.-a). Governance is positioned as
                a requirement to “enable, rather than restrict, access to trusted content”
                across the organization.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>C. Scalability &amp; Performance</h3>

          <div class="split">
            <div>
              <h4>Jupyter</h4>
              <p>
                Jupyter’s computing performance is strong because underlying libraries
                (NumPy, SciPy, etc.) are often implemented in low-level languages like C and
                Fortran (Perez &amp; Granger, 2007, p. 21). However, notebooks scale poorly
                in readability. As Beg et al. (2021) explain, large monolithic notebooks can
                become cluttered, prompting developers to migrate reusable code into external
                modules (p. 38).
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4>Tableau</h4>
              <p>
                Tableau is designed for horizontal scalability and can “connect natively to
                and live query against your commonly used business applications” (Tableau
                Software, n.d.-e). Performance depends heavily on data quality and workbook
                design; Tableau warns that improper data hygiene can degrade server
                performance (Tableau Software, n.d.-a).

          <h3>I. Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jupyter · Knowledge Creation.</strong>
            Jupyter enables bottom-up experimentation and exploration, aligning with
            strategies centered on innovation and discovery (Granger &amp; Perez, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tableau · Decision Support.</strong>
            Tableau’s strategic purpose is to centralize analytics and provide a “single
            source of truth” for organizational decision-makers (Tableau Software, n.d.-c).
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>II. Organizational Culture</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jupyter · Openness.</strong>
            Notebooks promote transparency through visible code, allowing collaborators to
            examine and understand the full analytic process (Beg et al., 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tableau · Data Culture.</strong>
            Tableau defines data culture as shared behaviors and beliefs that encourage the
            use of data across an organization, equipping people with “intuitive, productive
            insights” (Tableau Software, n.d.-f).
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>III. Organizational Processes</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jupyter · Iterative Process.</strong>
            Jupyter supports iterative workflows where users continuously refine code and
            immediately observe results (Granger &amp; Perez, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tableau · Structured Pipeline.</strong>
            Tableau’s analytics lifecycle—data preparation, visualization, publication, and
            consumption—reflects a more structured and governed process (Tableau Software,
            n.d.-a).
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>IV. Management &amp; Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jupyter · Enabling Leadership.</strong>
            Jupyter’s open-source ecosystem encourages autonomy, with leaders providing
            infrastructure rather than prescribing tools (Granger &amp; Perez, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tableau · Governance Leadership.</strong>
            Tableau emphasizes governance as central to scaling analytics environments,
            defining policies for access, security, and content management (Tableau Software,
            n.d.-a).
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>V. Technology</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jupyter · Interoperability.</strong>
            Jupyter notebooks are built on open standards (JSON, Python), enabling portability
            across systems (Beg et al., 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tableau · Proprietary Architecture.</strong>
            Tableau’s dashboards depend on its proprietary VizQL engine and ecosystem,
            enabling rapid-fire visual analysis but limiting portability outside Tableau
            environments (Tableau Software, n.d.-b; Tableau Software, n.d.-d).
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="subsection">
          <h3>VI. Politics</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Jupyter · Low Political Friction.</strong>
            As an open-source tool with no licensing costs, Jupyter reduces budget-related
            political tension (inferred from Granger &amp; Perez, 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Tableau · Resource Allocation.</strong>
            Tableau’s licensing and infrastructure costs require organizational negotiation.
            Tableau argues that proper governance “enables, rather than restricts,” equitable
            access across departments (Tableau Software, n.d.-a).
